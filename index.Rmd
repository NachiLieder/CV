  <h1>Nachi Lieder</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Data Scientist ‚Ä¢ Researcher ‚Ä¢ Sports Guru</p>
</div>

I‚Äôm a senior data scientist with a proven track record of leading high-impact projects that sit at the intersection of analytics, strategy, and execution. I specialize in building scalable, data-driven solutions that power decision-making across marketing, finance, and product ‚Äî from predictive modeling and causal inference to optimization, experimentation, and monitoring frameworks.

I thrive in environments that demand both technical depth and cross-functional leadership. Whether I‚Äôm aligning stakeholders on analytical direction, mentoring junior talent, or driving initiatives from concept to deployment, I bring a bias toward clarity, collaboration, and measurable outcomes.

While I‚Äôve developed and published advanced models across domains, I have a particular passion for sports analytics ‚Äî not just building models that simulate games or optimize lineups, but also staying active on the field and court myself. For me, data is not just a tool for analysis ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way to unlock performance, tell better stories, and push boundaries.

I bring curiosity, discipline, and a relentless focus on delivering results ‚Äî always bridging the gap between complexity and action.
